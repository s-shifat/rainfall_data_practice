# rainfall_data_practice


### How to use?

Run the [script.py]('./blob/main/script.py') file, then enter the asked file names and cordinate. The program is straight foroward to use.

### What it does?

This extracts rainfall data stored in a csv file with respect to `lat` and `lon` csv files. The rainfall data containing file cosists a every day rain fall data as matrix in a year with respect to `lat` values of that location on vertical direction and `lon` values on horzontal direction. So basically if you know the `lat` and `lon` values of a particular location, using this python script you can find out every day rainfall data in that particular location.

### Input format
* If you want to find rainfall data manually you can simply insert the  `lat` and `lon` values directly into the program.
* If you have multiple lat and lon values, then store them in an `excel` file with two columns
'lat' and 'lon'. Then directly feed this excel file to the program.
